  <h1 class="terms-title primary-color">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="terms-updated"><strong>Last Updated: January 15, 2025</strong></p>
  <p>
    At Harbor, your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains
    how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app. By
    using Harbor, you agree to the practices described below.
  </p>
  <h2 class="primary-color">1. Data Collection & Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We collect only the information necessary to provide our services, such as
      your name, Cornell affiliation, photos, and personality answers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your data is used solely to match you with other users and improve your
      experience on Harbor.
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for
      marketing purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      We collect your Cornell email address for account creation and
      verification purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      We may collect usage analytics to improve app functionality and user
      experience.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="primary-color">2. Image Privacy & Consent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When being shown, your images are blurred by default in our backend
      (approximately 80% blurred, where 100% is a plain color) to make it
      significantly hard to reveal your identity before you give consent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your unblurred images and identifying information are only revealed to
      another user after you explicitly give consent by clicking "Continue" when
      prompted in the chat.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are not responsible for anyone seeing your images after you have given
      consent (i.e., after you click "Continue").
    </li>
    <li>
      Images are stored securely in Firebase Storage with access controls.
    </li>
    <li>
      We use a progressive blur system that gradually reveals images based on
      mutual consent and conversation length.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="primary-color">3. Account Deletion & Data Removal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can delete your account and all associated data at any time using the
      "Delete Account" button in the app settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you delete your account, we permanently erase all your personal data,
      images, matches, conversations, and swipes from our servers.
    </li>
    <li>
      We also remove your data from Stream Chat (messaging platform) and
      Firebase Storage (image storage).
    </li>
    <li>Account deletion is irreversible and cannot be undone.</li>
    <li>
      We will also delete your Firebase Auth account and all associated
      authentication data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="primary-color">4. Data Security</h2>

      All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using Firebase's security
      infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or
      electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

    <li>

      We do not share your personal information with these services beyond what
      is necessary for app functionality.
