      <p class="terms-updated"><strong>Last Updated: June 29, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>
        At <strong>Harbor</strong>, your privacy is our top priority. This
        Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
        information when you use our app. By using Harbor, you agree to the
        practices described below.
      </p>
      <h2 class="primary-color">1. Data Collection & Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We collect only the information necessary to provide our services,
          such as your name, Cornell affiliation, photos, and personality
          answers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your data is used solely to match you with other users and improve
          your experience on Harbor.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties
          for marketing purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="primary-color">2. Image Privacy & Consent</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When being shown, your images are blurred by default in our backend
          (approximately 80% blurred, where 100% is a plain color) to make it
          significantly hard to reveal your identity before you give consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your unblurred images and identifying information are only revealed to
          another user after you explicitly give consent by clicking "Continue"
          when prompted in the chat.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are not responsible for anyone seeing your images after you have
          given consent (i.e., after you click "Continue").
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="primary-color">3. Account Deletion & Data Removal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can delete your account and all associated data and images at any
          time in the app settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you delete your account, we permanently erase all your personal
          data and images from our servers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="primary-color">4. Data Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data from
          unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or
          electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute
          security.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="primary-color">5. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Harbor is intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly
          collect personal information from children under 18.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="primary-color">6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of major changes via email or app notification.
