  <h1 class="terms-title primary-color">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="terms-updated"><strong>Last Updated: January 15, 2025</strong></p>
  <p>
    At Harbor, your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains
    how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app. By
    using Harbor, you agree to the practices described below.
  </p>
  <h2 class="primary-color">1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We collect only the information necessary to provide our services, such as
      your name, Cornell affiliation, photos, and personality answers.
    </li>
    <li>
      We collect your Cornell email address for account creation and
      verification purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      We may collect usage information to improve app functionality and user
      experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your data is used solely to match you with other users and improve your
      experience on Harbor.
    </li>
    <li>
      We collect anonymous usage analytics to understand overall activity, such
      as total users and daily/weekly active users. This information is
      aggregated, does not contain personal data, and cannot be used to identify
      you.
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for
      marketing purposes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="primary-color">2. Image Privacy & Consent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your images are blurred by default to protect your privacy until you give
      consent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your unblurred images and identifying information are only revealed to
      another user after you explicitly give consent by clicking "Continue" when
      prompted in the chat.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are not responsible for anyone seeing your unblurred images after you
      have given consent (i.e., after you click "Continue").
    </li>
    <li>Images are stored securely with appropriate access controls.</li>
    <li>
      We use a progressive blur system that gradually reveals images based on
      mutual consent and conversation length.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images shown before consent are <strong>highly blurred</strong>. It is
      extremely unlikely someone could identify you solely from these blurred
      images (see example below).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin: 16px 0; text-align: center">
    <img
      src="/images/blurred_example.jpg"
      alt="Example of a blurred image"
      style="max-width: 420px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px"
    />
    <p style="margin-top: 8px; color: #535864; font-size: 0.95rem">

      matches, swipes, messages, and other account data from our systems.
    </li>
    <li>Account deletion is irreversible and cannot be undone.</li>
    <li>
      We retain limited authentication information (such as your email) solely
      to prevent creation of another account with the same email address after
      deletion.
    </li>
  </ul>
